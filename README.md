# country information app// Realised in 1 week


Part 1
Create a Node.js application that does the following:
- Takes in one parameter from the command line, the name of a country. Note: command line arguments can be read from the global array `process.argv`
- Reads and parses the `countries.json` file. Note: you must use readFile and not readFileSync. Get it here: countries.jsonAfficher dans une nouvelle fenêtre
- Outputs information about that specific country. Must be in the following format:
Country: <country name>
Top Level Domain: <tld>

Part 2
- For the purposes of this exercise, you must create a separate module for reading and parsing the JSON file, named "json-file-reader".
- This module should have a function that takes in a filename and a callback function as a parameter. It should then read that file, then parse the JSON. Finally, it should call the callback function and pass the parsed JSON to it.
- One way to think of this module is as a helper that can read and parse any JSON file. It has nothing to do with 'countries', so to speak.
- Another way to think of it is as a small wrapper to fs.readFile, except that this function only works with JSON files.

- The output of the application should have the following format: 

Country: <country name>
Top Level Domain: <tld>
